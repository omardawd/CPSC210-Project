# My Personal Project: Gallery Thrift Store

## A Clothing Thrift Store App

### What does this app do?

<p>This project will represent a thrift store app that is uniquely designed to attract the consumer to post pictures of
their outfits as well as purchase clothing pieces from other users. The application will enable users to 
<strong>post</strong> photos of their outfits and let them <strong>label</strong> and <strong>price</strong> each 
clothing item in the photo so other users can interact with the listing by choosing to <strong>purchase</strong> an 
item by adding it to their shopping cart, <strong>favorite</strong> a listing, or <strong>go back</strong> to view
other listings.</p>

<br>

### Who will use this app?

<p>This app is made for anyone who has interest in fashion, wants to find inspiration for outfits, sell a clothing item
of theirs, or purchase a clothing item from another user. It's a great place to browse different outfits and find great 
clothing pieces while supporting sustainability and thrifting!</p>

<br>

### Why do I find this idea interesting?

<p>This project aligns with my interests because I like fashion and enjoy thrifting. However, at times I feel like I am
too tired to go to Main Street and look for something by visiting more than 2 stores. I find it more convenient to 
browse the internet to find exactly what I want without exerting any effort. I also feel like I can make this app glow
by having a beautiful design of my own taste.</p>
